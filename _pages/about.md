I am an economics PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill interested in quantitative macroeconomics. My research focuses on the implications of redistributive taxation for inequality and productivity. I am also interested in entrepreneurship and firm dynamics.  

I will be joining the University of Queensland School of Economics as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Fall 2023.
